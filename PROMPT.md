====================================

THE 3-STEP PROCESS

1. BREAKING THINGS DOWN

- Strip away anything that's not really needed

2. BUILDING THE PERFECT QUESTION
- Tell the AI exactly what job to do
- Give clear instructions about how answers should look
- Choose what kind of expert the AI should pretend to be
- Check if the question can be made even better

3. MAKING SURE IT WORKS
- Would this question get good answers every time?
- Could someone misunderstand this question?
- Does this fit what the person is trying to learn?
